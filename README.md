Raspberry-Pi-butler
===================

butler program for the Raspberry Pi system

Description:

Using the Rasberry Pi, you can have your own butler to speak to you anywhere there is a computer in the house. 
At the moment the butler program can do the following tasks:

1) State the current weather 
2) State your current calendar (adenda) from google calendar for 2 days.
3) calculate and state your current internet usage and percentage.

Dependencies: 

Make sure you have the following packages in debian: 
1) Weather (usage, gets current weather from a 2 hour basis) 
2) An AT@T router (only for internet usage, you can disable this if you want to). 
3) nginx (this is for the other computers in the house, I have the system setup for internal usage only).
